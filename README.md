#ParkIt 

##About
ParkIt is a project that assists drivers to find parking in various areas with available driveways. The project members are Jeffers Baxter, Anh Pham, Chyi Yen Wang, and Brian Navaluna.
You could almost think of project like "The AirBNB for parking". The application incorporates map and payment APIs to help those struggling to find parking spaces in their areas. 

##Technologies Used  
 
 - HTML
 - CSS
 - Javascript
 - jQuery
 - Bootstrap 
 - Ruby/Ruby on Rails
 - PostgreSQL
 - Google API
 - Stripe API
 
 ##Approach Taken 
 The process of the project started with using wireframes and ERDs, which helped immensively with keeping everyone on track. However, along the way, we stuggled a lot on which APIs to use. Due to time restrictions, we limited to only 2 APIs and scrapped some bonus features. Features that were omitted from the project were things such as the image uploads via Cloudinary API. Google maps Geocoder also took a long time to implement the basic functionality.


##User Stories
Parker - Parker is an independent, early-morning commuter, who desires a more valuable parking option than is already option near the city. Parker uses 3P because he can conveniently reserve a parking spot at an economic price.
Host - Elena is an independent, home owner who is looking for ways to augment her current income with little effort. She uses 3P to offer her available driveway to commuters who seek an efficient parking option.

##Other Information
Because there was so much to learn about Ruby on Rails and APIs in such as short time, we consistently ran into bugs. Main functionality is present within our application and other functionality may be implemented later.

##Status of Project
Currently, this project is an alpha release.
